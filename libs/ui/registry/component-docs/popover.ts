Importing @diffgazer/ui/components/popover without keys fails at module load with an error naming the missing @diffgazer/keys package.

MenuItem hotkey is a label only — bind the key in Menu onKeyDown, keep an entry the state cannot run listed and disabled with its reason instead of hiding it, and put the destructive entry last behind a MenuDivider. Inside the open menu ArrowUp/ArrowDown move the highlight and ArrowLeft/ArrowRight are inert (they only serve submenus); Escape and Tab close it. See the "Actions menu" example.',
