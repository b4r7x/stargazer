The default is owned by CSS — containers under 40rem and coarse pointers wrap, wider pointer-fine containers keep the filmstrip — so a phone gets wrapping without the consumer knowing the prop exists. Pass `wrap` or `wrap={false}` to force either state; the prop surfaces as data-wrap="on" / "off" and its absence is what hands the decision to CSS. Wrapping is pure geometry: no colors, no motion, and copy still yields the original line because text-indent is not copied.',
