The CSS-only body lock shared/dialog.css used to ship alongside it is gone: two locks compensated for the same scrollbar twice, and the page jumped on every open.

Use it to embed dialog chrome in a page, or to make the open state visible on a static page — see the Open State example. Inline content still honours open, so it unmounts when the consumer closes it.
