Local AI code review. Run one command, get a review from AI agents, and keep the app on your machine.

![Diffgazer demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/b4r7x/diffgazer/8119889d53f4a1457f0156d658e0bf08429e7f00/docs/assets/diffgazer-demo.gif)

## Why

I wanted my own code reviewer. Tools like Claude Code and Codex are great for writing code, but burning tokens on review when you could spend them building felt wrong.

Code review matters, especially now that we're all shipping AI-generated code faster than we can read it. Solo devs rarely get their code reviewed. Privacy, fear of judgment, or just nobody around. Diffgazer is my answer to that.

Run one command, get a review. Only the diff and prompt content go to the provider you choose.

## Project status

Diffgazer does what I built it for, so I've stopped adding to it. There is no roadmap. I may pick it up again later, or not; I haven't decided.

It is not abandoned. If issues or pull requests come in, I read them, answer questions, and fix bugs and security problems. If something breaks, [open an issue](https://github.com/b4r7x/diffgazer/issues). Security reports go through [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

What that means in practice:

- `diffgazer` on npm gets bug-fix releases when something needs fixing, not new features.
- The terminal UI (`--tui`) ships as a beta and stays one. Web mode is the finished path.
- `@diffgazer/ui` and `@diffgazer/keys` install from npm or from the hosted registry at https://r.b4r7.dev, and `@diffgazer/add` is on npm. Same deal as the CLI: bug-fix releases, no new features.

## Features

- **Local-first review** - the CLI starts an embedded server and web UI on localhost.
- **Review pipeline** - diff, context, review, and report steps run in order.
- **Web and terminal modes** - the browser UI by default; the Ink terminal UI (`--tui`) is a beta and stays opt-in (see [terminal UI](https://docs.diffgazer.b4r7.dev/app/tui)).
- **Issue details** - read findings inline against your diff with evidence and fix guidance.
- **Provider choice** - nine selectable hosted API products (see [providers reference](https://docs.diffgazer.b4r7.dev/app/reference/providers)).
- **Privacy controls** - localhost binding, host allowlist, CSRF protection, per-run token, explicit repo trust, and server-only secret/admission boundaries.
- **Registry and packages** - `@diffgazer/ui`, `@diffgazer/keys`, and `dgadd` support copy-first and package consumption paths.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g diffgazer
cd your-project
diffgazer
```

First run walks you through product selection, endpoint binding, authentication, exact model selection, the provider consent, and repo trust.

### Free models

Free tiers throttle. Z.AI's free Flash models allow one concurrent request (Diffgazer knows this and caps them to one dispatch at a time), and free OpenRouter models rate-limit under parallel load. Review agents run sequentially by default (`agentExecution: "sequential"`), and with a free model that's the setting to keep. Switch to `parallel` only on a paid tier that actually allows concurrent requests. See the [configuration reference](https://docs.diffgazer.b4r7.dev/app/reference/configuration).

## Privacy

Diffgazer runs on your machine. Your source and your credentials never reach a Diffgazer-hosted relay.

- **Your code leaves only when you ask for a review.** At that point the diff and the prompt built around it go straight to the product you configured, using your own credentials, under that product's terms. Diffgazer stores nothing remotely.
- **Setup makes a few catalog requests that carry no code.** The public models.dev catalog and the public OpenRouter and Ollama Cloud model lists are read without a credential; a saved key is sent only to the product it belongs to, to read that product's model list (OpenCode Zen's one key also reads its second endpoint's list). `DIFFGAZER_OFFLINE` skips every live request.
- **Secrets stay server-side.** Provider keys live in your OS keyring or in `0600` files under your Diffgazer home, and never appear in web, terminal, or CLI payloads. The one token the browser holds is the per-run shutdown token for the local API; it is not a provider credential.
- **The local server is local.** It binds `127.0.0.1`, allowlists the `Host` header, rejects cross-origin writes, and requires the per-run token on every API route but `/api/health`.
- **Reading the repository is explicit.** Routes that touch repository files require a trust grant for that exact repository root.
- **The provider notice is asked once, before anything is sent.** Declining cancels only that action, and the accepted notice stays readable from Settings.

Providers use what you send under their own terms; pick one whose notice you are comfortable with. The full account is in [the privacy and security doc](https://docs.diffgazer.b4r7.dev/app/concepts/privacy).

## Workspace

- `cli/diffgazer` - public `diffgazer` CLI
- `cli/add` - public `@diffgazer/add` installer, binary `dgadd`
- `cli/server` - private `@diffgazer/server` embedded Hono backend
- `libs/core` - private `@diffgazer/core` shared schemas and utilities
- `libs/ui` - public `@diffgazer/ui` package
- `libs/keys` - public `@diffgazer/keys` package
- `libs/registry` - private `@diffgazer/registry` workspace library
- `apps/docs` - documentation app
- `apps/web` - private `@diffgazer/web` product frontend
- `apps/landing` - private `@diffgazer/landing` landing page

## Source Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b4r7x/diffgazer.git
cd diffgazer
pnpm install
pnpm run build
```

The root build prepares shared registry and documentation artifacts once before Turbo starts the
parallel package builds. Focused package builds are not self-contained: a direct
`pnpm --filter @diffgazer/add build` skips workspace dependencies, and the bundle scripts it runs
import the compiled `@diffgazer/registry`, which no clean checkout carries. Run the root build, or at
least `pnpm --filter @diffgazer/registry build`, before any focused `@diffgazer/add` build or pack.

## Development

```bash
pnpm run docs:dev
pnpm run web:dev
pnpm run diffgazer:dev
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run test
pnpm run verify
```

This repository is one workspace with a single root install and lockfile.

## Consumption Paths

`@diffgazer/ui`, `@diffgazer/keys`, and `@diffgazer/add` are on npm; `npm view @diffgazer/ui version` and the two siblings return versions. The release contract is in [PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md](./PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md).

| Path | @diffgazer/ui | @diffgazer/keys |
|------|---------------|-----------------|
| Manual copy / shadcn | All components, hooks, libs | Standalone hooks only |
| `dgadd` CLI | All components, hooks, libs | Standalone hooks only |
| npm package | All exports | All exports (including provider-backed APIs) |

### Copy-first mode (`dgadd`)

`dgadd` is the binary of `@diffgazer/add` on npm. Install it as a dev dependency of the target app, which puts `dgadd` on `pnpm exec`:

```bash
pnpm add -D @diffgazer/add
pnpm exec dgadd init
pnpm exec dgadd add ui/button keys/navigation
```

`npx @diffgazer/add init` and `npx @diffgazer/add add ui/button keys/navigation` do the same without the dev dependency.

Copy mode installs source files the consuming app owns. UI components require Tailwind CSS v4 and the copied `src/styles/styles.css`. Keys standalone hooks require no CSS setup. `dgadd init` also supports the recovery-only `--reset-manifest` option, and `-s, --silent` is available globally to suppress non-error output. See [cli/add/README.md](./cli/add/README.md#install) for the full command reference.

### Runtime package mode

```bash
npm install @diffgazer/ui @diffgazer/keys
```

Package consumers import Tailwind CSS v4, `@diffgazer/ui/sources.css`, and `@diffgazer/ui/styles.css`. `@diffgazer/keys` is a required peer of `@diffgazer/ui` in package mode. Keys provider-backed APIs (`KeyboardProvider`, `useKey`, `useScope`, `useFocusZone`, `useScopedNavigation`) are package-only.

### Direct shadcn / manual copy

The hosted registry at `https://r.b4r7.dev` is live (see [PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md](./PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md#hosted-registry-status)); install straight from it:

```bash
npx shadcn add https://r.b4r7.dev/r/ui/button.json
npx shadcn add https://r.b4r7.dev/r/keys/navigation.json
```

Installing from the hosted registry needs neither a checkout of this repository nor an npm package. `dgadd` (`pnpm exec dgadd add ui/button keys/navigation`, see [Copy-first mode](#copy-first-mode-dgadd)) and the runtime packages come from npm.

Versioning, release gates, migration expectations, and artifact ownership are documented in [PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md](./PACKAGE_GOVERNANCE.md).

## Published-Mode Smoke Test

Packs local workspace packages into isolated temp projects and verifies public imports/bins. This does not install from the public npm registry.

```bash
pnpm run smoke:packages
```

## Live Review E2E (opt-in)

Boots the real embedded API server against a scratch git repo, runs one bounded
single-lens review through a real provider over HTTP + SSE, and verifies the run
persists. Off by default; skips honestly without the opt-in envs. Uses an isolated
temp config home — your `~/.diffgazer` is never touched. Spends tokens on the
selected model (the flash set below).
The release gate is the full {openrouter, opencode-zen, zai, ollama-cloud} ×
{small, medium, large} matrix. A run reviews only the products named in
`DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E_PRODUCT` (`openrouter` when it is unset), so the full matrix
lists all four there.

```bash
DIFFGAZER_SMOKE_ALLOW_NETWORK=1 DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E=1 OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-... pnpm run smoke:review
```

```bash
# Release gate: the full 4 x 3 matrix, every product named
DIFFGAZER_SMOKE_ALLOW_NETWORK=1 DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E=1 \
DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E_PRODUCT=openrouter,opencode-zen,zai,ollama-cloud \
DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E_SCENARIO=small,medium,large \
pnpm run smoke:review
```

Every scenario of a provider runs one primary from the flash set — openrouter
`qwen/qwen3.8-flash`, opencode-zen `qwen3.8-flash` on the OpenCode Go endpoint
(`https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1`, a subscription pool; `/zen/v1` does not serve the
flash ids), zai `glm-5.3-flash`, ollama-cloud `glm-5.3-flash` — and walks an ordered
fallback chain only when a member is down: openrouter `z-ai/glm-5.3-flash` →
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash-0731`; opencode-zen `glm-5.3-flash` → `deepseek-v4-flash`;
ollama-cloud `deepseek-v4-flash:0731` → `gpt-oss:20b`; zai `glm-4.5-air` (the proven
priced incumbent, outside the flash set).
"Down" is one of HTTP 402 (entitlement), 401/404 (not supported), 429 (capacity),
400 (model unavailable), 5xx (outage), or a timed-out attempt (harness watchdog,
dispatch wall, headers/answer-idle budget, review wall-clock) — one hop per
timeout, so a logical cell never exceeds two watchdogs (worst case 2 × 600/900/1200 s).
In a multi-cell run each hop prints a WARN line labelled with its cell (a
single-cell run prints it unlabelled), and boots a fresh cell whose header names
the model and its chain position; a run without a WARN line
ran its primary. A `DIFFGAZER_LIVE_E2E_MODEL` pin never falls back.

```
WARN: (ollama-cloud/small) live review e2e — glm-5.3-flash is down (entitlement: Ollama Cloud reported billing or quota exhausted (HTTP 402). Check the account balance or plan, or change the model.); retrying the cell on fallback deepseek-v4-flash:0731
```
