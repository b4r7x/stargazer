# Stage 2: Serve static SPA
# alpine-slim, not alpine: the full variant ships modules we never load
# (image-filter, xslt, geoip, njs); image-filter's chain libgd -> libXpm ->
# libXt -> libSM -> libuuid drags util-linux's libuuid into the image. A deploy was blocked by
# seven util-linux HIGH CVEs (in mount/nsenter, not even present here) because
# Alpine had published the fixed util-linux for aarch64 but not x86_64, so
# `apk upgrade` could not help on the CI runner. alpine-slim is nginx +
# busybox only: nothing to patch there and less to attack.

# The pinned base lags Alpine's security releases and the deploy workflow
# refuses to promote an image with HIGH/CRITICAL findings, so pull the fixed

# same version string as the nginx.org build this image pins, and with no
# nginx-module-* packages to hold it back apk "upgrades" to it. That swaps the
# binary the digest promises for Alpine's and installs Alpine's nginx.conf,
# which includes conf.d/*.conf at the root context (http-level config lives in
# http.d/ there), so `nginx -t` below rejects our http-level directives.
